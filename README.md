### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working ...  As an Sr.SDE at Amazon, I created LiveCode a collaborative code editor used for hiring in Amazon and many systems not exposed to outside world for retail analytics.
- 📚 I authored... [Definitive Guide AWS Application Integration](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-5401-1) for APress Publishers and several courses on [JavaFX on Pluralsight](https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/author/buddha-jyothiprasad)
- 🎯 I contributed to [JSR-381](https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=381), the Java API specification for visual recognition, which provides APIs for detecting, recognizing and annotating images with focus on image content analysis, facial detection, facial emotions, image tagging, specifying image classifiers and training visual data. 
- 💬 Ask me anything ...   Yes, I am happy to help, learn and collaborate anything you see in my repos or you read about me.
